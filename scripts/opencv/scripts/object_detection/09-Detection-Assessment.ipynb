    "## Russian License Plate Blurring\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to your object detection project! Your goal will be to use Haar Cascades to blur license plates detected in an image!\n",
    "\n",
    "Russians are famous for having some of the most entertaining DashCam footage on the internet (I encourage you to Google Search \"Russian DashCam\"). Unfortunately a lot of the footage contains license plates, perhaps we could help out and create a license plat blurring tool?\n",
    "\n",
    "OpenCV comes with a Russian license plate detector .xml file that we can use like we used the face detection files (unfortunately, it does not come with license detectors for other countries!)\n",
    "\n",
    "----\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3 Ways to Approach this project:\n",
    "* Just go for it! Use the image under the DATA folder called car_plate.jpg and create a function that will blur the image of its license plate. Check out the Haar Cascades folder for the correct pre-trained .xml file to use.\n",
    "* Use this notebook! Here we offer a guide of what main steps you should take to complete the project.\n",
    "* Jump to the solutions notebook and video to treat this entire project as code-along project where you can code along with us.\n",

It's simply [Numpy Slicing](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/15589517/how-to-crop-an-image-in-opencv-using-python), you just need to convert the information about the top left corner of the rectangle and width and height, into indexing position values.\n",
